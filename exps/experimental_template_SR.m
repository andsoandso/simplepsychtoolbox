function experiment_template_SR(exp_file_name),
% This is a simple deterministic stimulus-response task.
% An image is presented for 2 seconds, 
% while waiting for a response.  Verbal feedback is 
% displayed contigent on the response.  Trial order,
% as well as the images to present and the correct reponses
% are stored and read from exp_file_name, whose rows 
% are prepresented serially  See 1_trials.dat for format 
% info.  1_trials.dat was created with create_triallist_SR.m.
%
% Note: I have found that a complete seperation
% between logic and data for experimental programs to faciliatate
% code reuse and, more importantly, simplfy code understanding;
% it is easier to tell what happens.
% That is as done here, I recommend one set of code to generate 
% the triallist and one to present and collected responses on 
% that triallist.  These two functions could, of course, easily be 
% combined in a batch script.
