	% We use the fact that sin(x) has 1 cycle every 2*pi pixels.  That

	% Using a conversion factor of stim_pixels/visual_angle_in_degrees

	% Next we use that the gradient of the curve 
	% z = sin(theta)*x+cos(theta)*y
	% has constant length, meaning that the spatial frequency of

	% sin(k*(sin(theta)*x+cos(theta)*y)) for all values of theta.
