This is a set of functions to (greatly, I hope) ease use of psychtoolbox (http://psychtoolbox.org/HomePage).

[11/16/2011] While feature complete for this inital posting, such as it is, substantial testing and debugging is still needed. Once that is done this file will be updated.

[11/21/2011] Functions have all received (at least) basic testing and seem to be working as intended.  For use information, see each functions own inline comments and the two experimental templates along, with their triallist creation mates (e.g. experimental_template_II.m and create_trialist_II.m).

** Kurt - if you want to modify these, we should talk first. In short, add functionality by creating new functions (based on or calling old) not by adding new arguments or returns to the existing set, i.e. backwards compatiblity is good, especially if we are both going to be hacking on these. **
