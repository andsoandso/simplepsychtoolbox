This is a set of functions to (greatly, I hope) ease use of psychtoolbox (http://psychtoolbox.org/HomePage).  If downloading this from github, see the tags tab for 'stable' versions.

[11/16/2011] While feature complete for this inital posting, such as it is, substantial testing and debugging is still needed. Once that is done this file will be updated.

[11/21/2011] Functions have all received (at least) basic testing and seem to be working as intended.  For use information, see each functions own inline comments and the two experimental templates along, with their triallist creation mates (e.g. experimental_template_II.m along with create_trialist_II.m).

[1/2/2012] Functions that end in 'INC' are for use with the Siemens 3T at the Intermountain Neuroimaging Consortium (INC) facility located at the University of Colorado at Boulder.  Some exist for MRI interaction, others (i.e. get_resp_INC) are workarounds for specfiic bugs or oddities in that system.
